This game is made for our AP major project.
It is clone of the famous Color Switch game.
A working demo of the game can be seen here (YOUTUBE DEMO LINK).
The game is made using Java and JavaFX.
The objective of the game is to collect
as many stars as possible by manoeuvring the obstacles. If you hit any obstacle, you can continue
with your earned stars or the game ends and you have to start from the beginning. This is a high
score game. We have developed only the endless (infinity) game mode of the classic
gameplay.
